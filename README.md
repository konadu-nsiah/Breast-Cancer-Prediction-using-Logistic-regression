BREAST CANCER PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION

This repository contains code for training a machine learning model to predict breast cancer using logistic regression. The model is trained on the popular Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.



DATASET

The dataset used for training the model is breast-cancer.csv. It consists of various features such as radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, and others, along with the target variable indicating the diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign).


MODEL TRAINING

The Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Logistic_Regression.ipynb Jupyter Notebook contains the code for preprocessing the data, training the logistic regression model, and evaluating its performance using log score.


DEPENDANCIES

The code is written in Python and requires the following libraries:

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn
