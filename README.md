# BREAST CANCER PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION

This repository contains code for training a machine learning model to predict breast cancer using logistic regression. The model is trained on the popular Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Environment creation
Run the code below in your terminal to create your virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv env
```

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is breast-cancer.csv. It consists of various features such as radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, and others, along with the target variable indicating the diagnosis (M=malignant, B=benign)
